Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes. they did.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, none of them did the task right. The AlexNet model finds out this is an image of a howler monkey! But the two other models, ResNet and VGG, identified the image as "malinois," a very similar bread to the "german shepherd."


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, they did the task quite well.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Based on the accuracy, it is evident that the ResNet and VGG outperformed the AlexNed model. But to choose between these two models, which had the same performance in accuracy, I would choose the faster one, the ResNet, because of its total run time: 00:00:00 versus the 00:00:03 for VGG. But to be honest, I think four images are way too small to decide which model is better, and also it may depend on the task, but here the winner is ResNet.
